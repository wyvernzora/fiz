  Test cases from the lab assignment
    ✓ (inc (inc 5)) should result in 7 
    ✓ (dec (inc (dec 3))) should result in 2 
    ✓ (dec (ifz 0 4 (inc 1))) should result in 3 
    ✓ (ifz 1 (halt) 5) should result in 5 
    ✓ (inc 4 5) should return syntax error 
    ✓ (ifz 0 halt) should return syntax error 
    ✓ (inc (dec )) should return syntax error 
    ✓ user-defined and recursive function
